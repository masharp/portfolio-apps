## Coding Practices

### Kent Back's Four Rules
  1. Run all the tests
  2. Contain no duplicate code
  3. Express all the ideas the author wants to express
  4. Minimize classes and methods

### SOLID principles:
  1. Single Responsibility (SRP): ```A class (component) should have one, and only one, reason
  to change```.
  2. Open-Closed (OCP): ```A system should be open for extension, but closed for
  modification```.
  3. Liskov Substitution (LSP): ```Derived types should be substitutable for their base types```.
  4. Interface Segregation (ISP): ```Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions```.
  5. Dependency Inversion (DIP): ```Interfaces should be small, focused on a specific use case```.

### The DRY Principle
```
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
```
