#Shoreside File Metadata Microservice
  A web API that allows a user to submit a FormData file upload parameter with the request.
  When the file is submitted, file metadata will be returned as JSON. Uses the [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)
  npm package as a middleware to handle FormData file parsing.
