#Shoreside APIs
  This is a folder that contains the code for various web API projects I have
  completed. Most of these are implemented within my Software on the Shore website.

###APIs
  * (Shoreside Timestamp)[https://www.softewareontheshore.com/shoreside-timestamp/]
    * Accepts a string as a parameter and checks if it contains either a UNIX timestamp
      or a natural language data. If so, returns both the UNIX timestamp and the natural date.
      If not, returns null for both.
