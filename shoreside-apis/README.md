#Shoreside APIs
  This is a folder that contains the code for various web API projects I have
  completed. Most of these are implemented within my Software on the Shore website.

###APIs
  * (Shoreside Timestamp Microservice)[https://www.softwareontheshore.com/apis/timestamp]
    * Accepts a string as a parameter and checks if it contains either a UNIX timestamp
      or a natural language data. If so, returns both the UNIX timestamp and the natural date.
      If not, returns null for both. FreeCodeCamp project.

  * (Shoreside MyInfo Microservice)[https://www.softwareontheshore.com/apis/myinfo]
    * This is a web API project that parses the request header for the ip address, language,
      and browser operating system and then returns them as a JSON object. FreeCodeCamp project.
